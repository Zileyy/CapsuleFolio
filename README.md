CapsuleFolio is simple passion project made for manually tracking data for RMR2020 sticker capusle investments.

Idea is for you to enter quantity of the capsules you have and the selling price so program can make a price log. The program will send information to Google Spreadsheet of your choice when you login with your Google account, where you can customise however you want to see your data because program automatically sends data to the named column no matter where it is on the sheet.

Other than making it fancy, data provides bunch of information like total profit earned, profit per capsule, date and time when log is made and much more. Which makes it perfect for using data visualization tools that are already provided with Google Spreadsheet.

[!] NOTE: This is passion project that i made for myself however anyone knowing how to make Google Cloud project can use this script simply by putting your Google Cloud app credentials file in "data" folder renamed as "credentials.json". After that just start "setup.py" and do the first time setup module and you're good to go :)
